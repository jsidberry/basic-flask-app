# basic-flask-app
Scaffolding for a very basic Flask application


It has four (4) types of basic elements needed for any web-appplication built using Flask.

1. the `application` (usually written in `python` and named `app.py`) = all logic is coded here
2. `templates/html` = scaffolding for the views (the web-pages the users see)
3. `static/css` = location for all Cascading Style Sheets (CSS files)
4. `static/js` = lcoation for all the JavaScript code

TODO: outline how to create a completed app into a single executable file

After cloning repo to local environment, execute/run the `setup_environment.sh` shell script by using this command: `cd basic-flask-app`, and then `./setup_environment.sh`.
 If you see something like this on the command line interface, then your development environment is set up and Flask is runing; you should be able to see website at http://127.0.0.1:5000. Things are good...
