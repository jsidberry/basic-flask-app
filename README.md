Scaffolding for a very basic Flask application


It has four (4) types of basic elements needed for any web-appplication built using Flask.

1. the `application` (usually written in `python` and calls `app.py`) = all logic is coded here
2. `templates/html` = scaffolding for the views (the web-pages the users see)
3. `static/css` = locations for all Cascading Style Sheets (CSS files)
4. `static/js` = lcoation for all the JavaScript code
